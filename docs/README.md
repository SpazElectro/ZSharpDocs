ZSharp is a language that is similar to C#, created by a youtuber called [AstroSam](https://www.youtube.com/c/AstroSamDev), you could also watch his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP9n5wHyemU) on how he made ZSharp, It can be used to create a game or a console application. It is a language that is similar to C#, but it is much more lightweight and easy to use.

ZSharp was created as a little side-project for a youtube video by [AstroSam](https://www.youtube.com/c/AstroSamDev), and it is open source on [github](https://www.github.com/sam-astro/Z-Sharp).

ZSharp uses the [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) library and the [SDL2_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) library and the [SDL2_ttf](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf) library to create a game/display a window.
